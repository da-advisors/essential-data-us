    <h1>About America's Essential Data</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="about-section">
    <p>America's Essential Data is a collaborative effort dedicated to documenting the value that data produced by the federal government provides for American lives and livelihoods. This effort supports federal agency implementation of the bipartisan Evidence Act of 2018, which requires that agencies prioritize data that deeply impact the public.</p>
    
    <p>America's Essential Data wouldn't be possible without the federal data users and stakeholders who share their use cases.</p>
