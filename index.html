      <li>Data users and advocates to be more effective when engaging with lawmakers and federal agencies for continued resourcing of federal data programs.</li>
      <li>Federal agency data stewards and their leadership to better understand the true value of their data, especially as it relates to administration priorities.</li>
      <li>Demonstrating the broad real-world value of federal data is the most strategic path to ensuring its continued flow.</li>
