  <h3>Archiving</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <b><a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/" target="_blank">Data Rescue Project</a></b> is a coordinated effort among a group of data organizations, including <a href="https://iassistdata.org/" target="_blank">IASSIST</a>, <a href="https://rdapassociation.org/" target="_blank">RDAP</a>, and members of the <a href="https://datacurationnetwork.org/" target="_blank">Data Curation Network</a>. The project’s goal is to serve as a clearinghouse for data rescue-related efforts and data access points for public US governmental data that are currently at risk. Efforts include: data gathering, data curation and cleaning, data cataloging, and providing sustained access and distribution of data assets.</li>
      <li>The <b><a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2025/01/30/preserving-public-u-s-federal-data/?ref=404media.co" target="_blank">Harvard Law School Library Innovation Lab</a></b> has created a data vault to download, sign as authentic, and make available copies of public government data that is most valuable to researchers, scholars, civil society and the public at large across every field. To begin, they have collected major portions of the datasets tracked by data.gov, federal Github repositories, and PubMed. In coming weeks they will share full data and metadata for the collection so far.</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/" target="_blank">ICPSR</a></b> is an international consortium of more than 810 academic institutions and research organizations, based at the University of Michigan. Through <a href="https://www.datalumos.org/datalumos/" target="_blank">DataLumos</a>, an ICPSR archive for valuable government data resources, they’re working to preserve, document, and disseminate thousands of files from agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Education.</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.ipums.org/" target="_blank">IPUMS</a></b>, based at the University of Minnesota, provides census and survey data from around the world integrated across time and space, including major data sources from the US government, such as the Census, American Community Survey, Current Population Survey, and more.</li>
